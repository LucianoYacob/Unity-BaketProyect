# Unity-BaketProyect
My first video game with the style of Temple Run make with the Unity engine, where we are a basketball that needs to avoid obstacles and accumulate the most point.

Warning:
1_ This game is designed to work properly on android devices, if you want to run it on PC you should change the platform to "PC" in the build settings.
2_ On PC, it is necessary to add the specific functionality to execute a jump with the ball, so that you can jump you must go to the '_Scripts' folder, then open the 'PlayerController.css' file, go to line 87 and follow the instructions. (It's just changing the jump value in a conditional).
3_ To be able to visualize the text it may ask you to install TMP (text mesh pro), Just install or import and it's good to go.
4_ The version of Unity to run correctly is 2020.1.0f1.
